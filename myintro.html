        <p>Hello! My name is Kyra. I'm a first-year student at Barnard College 
            majoring in Computer Science. I'm interested in exploring front-end 
            and back-end development as well as working on interesting and 
            innovative projects. In my free time, I enjoy playing ultimate frisbee 
            and exploring New York City. 

            Feel free to connect with me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kyra-krishna/"> LinkedIn</a>.
